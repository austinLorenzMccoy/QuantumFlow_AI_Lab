## üß© Core Modules

### 1. Strategy Generation Engine
Uses RAG and LLMs to generate trading strategies based on user goals and market data.

### 2. Adaptive Optimization Engine
Refines strategies using RL and Bayesian optimization, with multi-agent collaboration.

### 3. Real-Time Execution & Monitoring
Executes strategies via configurable exchange APIs and monitors performance in real-time.

### 4. Real-Time Communication
Implements a WebSocket-based real-time data streaming system as an alternative to Kafka. This provides:

- **Low-latency data streaming**: Real-time market data and trading signals with minimal overhead
- **Bidirectional communication**: Enables both server-to-client and client-to-server messaging
- **Connection management**: Robust handling of client connections, disconnections, and reconnections
- **Channel-based messaging**: Publish/subscribe pattern for targeted data distribution
- **Browser compatibility**: Direct connection from web clients without additional libraries
- **Simplified architecture**: Eliminates the complexity of Kafka setup and maintenance

### 5. Risk & Sentiment Analysis
Mitigates risks using external data and NLP-based sentiment analysis.
